    <h3>My life story</h3>
    <p title="how it all began">
        Minecraft, as I begin a long path that would lead me to, where I'm at today. But I can't forget the long journey that Minecraft has taken me over the year.Like even texture pack then to wonderful world of mods
then to modpack and now to make a modded Minecraft server to share with the world even for my family.This journey is not over by a long shoot even right now i'm making a website to the world and to prove that anyone with
a mindset can do anything they put their mind to. Yes, I not yet finished with my learning skill but who is it a skill that never drops only grow with age.I'm here to tell the story of my mistake and help people out with
their Minecraft building skill. No not by any mean am I a good builder but i'm here to show waht a mindset can do. I'm here to help and to give a second eye to show the ladder of building even to help people become a master 
builder with a soul even to sirpass me. Which is great no I'm a crapy builder but that never stop me and never will. It an art and way to escape the real world and design anything you want. Just open your eye and look over 
the wall to the world of fantasy and you'll never go back. Let's get start on your long journey to an amzing world.
