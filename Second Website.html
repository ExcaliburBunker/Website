                <h2>
                    My start in Minecraft
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Minecraft, as I begin a long path that would lead me to, where I'm at today. But I can't forget the long journey that Minecraft
                    has taken me over the year.Like even texture pack then to wonderful world of mods then to modpack and
                    now to make a modded Minecraft server to share with the world even for my family.This journey is not
                    over by a long shoot even right now i'm making a website to the world and to prove that anyone with a
                    mindset can do anything they put their mind to. Yes, I not yet finished with my learning skill but who
                    is it a skill that never drops only grow with age.I'm here to tell the story of my mistake and help people
                    out with their Minecraft building skill. No not by any mean am I a good builder but i'm here to show
                    waht a mindset can do. I'm here to help and to give a second eye to show the ladder of building even
                    to help people become a master builder with a soul even to sirpass me. Which is great no I'm a crapy
                    builder but that never stop me and never will. It an art and way to escape the real world and design
                    anything you want. Just open your eye and look over the wall to the world of fantasy and you'll never
                    go back.<em>Let's get start on your long journey to an amzing world.</em>

                    Modded building
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My first build was a stone castle just a block no shape, no detail no personality. But as I got older and got more in depth
                    understand the fundamental of building your world open up. To a new world but as I got older and started
                    the amazing world of modded building a new level of detail can be shown.

                                The world of building a long start to an amazing world. Where the great part of your imagination come out and you can express
                                yourself in amazing ways that you never could do before. Yes, the hard part of every builder
                                is trying to find inspiration and try not to copy. But sometimes to learn is to copy and
                                to learn. An element is not easily explained you have to copy to learn the technic. No one
                                is a master build it an art just like a flower it hides is beautiful petal and blossom into
                                a rose. You have to look for an idea and to be happy with your work here an quotes that best
                                express it.
